        <p>on this page i will be talking about my favourite books and games</p>
        <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>The Lane Winslow murder mystery series by Iona Whishaw </li>
            <li>As Long As The Lemon Trees Grow by Zoulfa Katouh</li>
            <li>The Poppy War Trilogy by R.F. Kuang</li>
            <li>The Gentlemen Bastards sequence by Scott Lynch</li>
            <li>The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb</li>        
        </ol>
        <p>The lane winslow murder mysteries single handedly sparked my love for reading so it holds a special place in my heart. As long as the lemon trees grow
            was sad and heartwrenching but also hopeful and so beautiful i will never get over it. the poppy war trilogy is all about war, genocide, torture and drug abuse and the author really doesn't sugar coat any of it which makes these books kind of hard to read but they were written so well and are definitely some of the best books i've ever read.
            The gentlemen bastards sequence is dark and funny and the characters are great. The Farseer trilogy, These books are all about assassins, magic and a boatload of political intrigue and the author put so much
            detail and care into every word that it made me want stop reading so it never ends. i stared at the wall for like 5 minutes after i finished the last book because it was so great.</p>
        <h2>My Favourite Games</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Elden Ring</li>
            <li>Baldur's Gate 1 and 3</li>
            <li>Slime Rancher</li>        
        </ol>
        <p>Elden ring was absolute prefection in every way from the story to the bosses to the characters, this is my favorite game of all time 10/10 would recommend.
            I really like the story, characters and gameplay of the D&D games and how easy it is to immerse yourself in the world as you play.
            This game is so silly Literally all i have to do is take care of funky slimes and explore but i think its simplicity is what makes it so great. </p>
